Hello world! I've been thinking about creating a blog since I started my website. So I discovered this framework to build static websites called <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a>. I'm using, by the way, a theme called "Hugo blog awesome", created by Sid. You can find it on his Github - his theme is credited on the footer! 

Yesterday I found <a href="https://blog.sapico.me/posts/setting-up-a-blog-on-cloudflare-pages/" target="_blank">this little article</a> about "Setting up a blog on Cloudflare Pages" written by Sapico. It was a bit of a trouble to set up the page since hugo wasn't rendering locally and the deployment took a bit at first, but now I managed to get the theme working at least locally, and I'll if it work publishing this post.

## Now, what will I post here?  

I don't really know, but I think this is a good place to share something relevant on what I'm doing, write anything that comes to my mind, my opinion about something I found, or the processes of any project. My interests are varied and so the content of this blog will be.

## About comments and interaction
By the time being I'm not planning to add a comment section until I make my own comment system. I don't really like to -and will not- depend on services like Disqus, for several reasons like the nasty advertisement I've seen on disqus and possible tracking and privacy concerns I have with . Meanwhile, I will open a one-way email address to receive comments. But now, let's see what comes first: my own comment system, or an email address.

## Final thoughts
To conclude this first post, I want to invite you to do somehting similar if you can or want. I think it is nice to have a place you own, free from distractions like on social media. Now, go ahead and add this site's RRS to your RRS feed reader of choice!

Nice day or night! Bye~
